                <h4>“Be willing to be a beginner every single morning.”</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing 
                    something that you have never done before. It's a new 
                    challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software 
                  development, something so specific that it's probably 
                    never been done before.
 
                <br><br>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the 
                    right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in 
                    the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology 
                    and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going 
                    because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>"Feeling uncomfortable is the key to success."</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are 
                    learning to write your first programming language, 
                    or just the latest framework, you go through this 
                    uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you 
                    are looking at is doing this THING but you don't 
                    understand HOW exactly it's happening.
 
                <br><br>You see when you encounter a new programming language 
                    part of your learning process includes learning to 
                    train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read 
                    a good deal of code even when you don't totally 
                    understand what it's doing.</p>
